## Introduction to Whiplash
Whiplash: How to Survive Our Faster Future (2016) is a book by Joi Ito and Jeff Howe. Joi Ito is a Japanese activist, entrepreneur, venture capitalist, Director of the MIT Media Lab and Professor of the Practice of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joi_Ito)) - the Wikipedia entry is really worth reading as Joi Ito is quite a character. 

Jeff Howe is Visiting Scholar, MIT
Assistant Professor, School of Journalism at Northwestern University. 

As I said Joi Ito is a very special person. Author [Cory Doctorow says](http://boingboing.net/2016/12/06/whiplash-joi-itos-nine-prin.html) his approach to life is seemingly impossible-to-characterize. Nonetheless Ito managed to describe his approach in a set of 9 compact principles:
1. Disobedience over compliance

2. Pull over push

3. Compasses over maps

4. Emergence over authority

5. Learning over education

6. Resilience over strength

7. Risk over safety

8. Practice over theory

9. Systems over Objects

It are these principles which are being discussed in the book we're about to read. There is another principle which is not listed here, but mentioned in the introduction: 
>Learning is something you do for yourself, education is something done to you. 

What are the guiding principles of creative learning? Mitch Resnick (Lifelong Kindergarten): Projects, Peers, Passion and Play. 

### Introduction
The book starts on December 28, 1895, with the LumiÃ¨res brothers showing not so much movies but moving pictures. The technology of film had been created, but not the medium. 

The same happened when Thomas Edison marketed the first phonograph or "talking machine", thinking it was just a device for businessmen to dictate their correspondence. 

And of course, in the seventies industry experts were convinced that an individual would never need to have a computer in her house, and this happened again when a new mobile phone, the iPhone, was announced. 

**Three conditions that define our era**
- Asymmetry. Meaning that in the past large forces could only be counteracted by forces of equal size qnd strength. Not any longer: small terrorist bands can cause major disruption, small groups of hackers can wreak havoc, one enterpreneur can cause upheaval in an entire industry and one trader can cause a meltdown. 

- Complexity. Inherently interdisciplinary field of study. The level of complexity is influenced by heterogeneity, q network, interdependency qnd adaptation. 

- Uncertainty. 

So the question is: how do you rebuild something from the principle of not-knowing? 

**Conclusion**: we are all blinkered by prevailing systems of thought. This book is 
> about what you don't know you know, and why it's important to question these problematic assumptions.

In philosophy Michel Foucault talks about [episteme](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/#4.2) and [Thomas Kuhn](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn/#3) about "paradigm". The [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/#4.3) explains the "archaelogical method" of Foucault: 
>... systems of thought and knowledge (epistemes or discursive formations, in Foucault's terminology) are governed by rules, beyond those of grammar and logic, that operate beneath the consciousness of individual subjects and define a system of conceptual possibilities that determines the boundaries of thought in a given domain and period. 

Why do we have to be aware of all this? Because 
> our technologies have outpaced our ability, as a society, to understand them. Now we need to catch up. 

The principles we mentioned are tips for how to use the world's new operating system. That system is based on the law of Moore (cfr. Thank you for being late) and the Internet.
