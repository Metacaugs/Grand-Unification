Summary Chapter One Whiplash
Emergence over Authority
[Roland's Original Collaborative version on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/s/Bkn6_l1ne)

A collective intelligence is emerging. It could topple governments during the Arab Spring, attack governments and companies via Anonymous, leaders such as Sanders and Trump surfed popular movements (what about Farage). Steven Johnson is a science writer who wrote the book [Emergence, The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains and Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence:_The_Connected_Lives_of_Ants,_Brains,_Cities,_and_Software) (2011) which is very inspiring in this context. [The Guardian explains](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/oct/15/society): 
>Emergence is a tour of what are called adaptive self-organising systems: systems that are made up of many interacting agents who are individually not terribly smart, but who collectively come up with intelligent higher-level behaviour. 

At the end of this chapter there is an interesting PS about the Arab Spring. Joi Ito describes how a network of self-hosted blogs is now confronted with walled gardens such as Facebook and Twitter, where hate speech and manipulation are being launched in very effective ways. 

At MIT Media Group the [Scalable Cooperation research group](http://scalable.media.mit.edu/) wants to build tools for the scalable cooperation to advance new forms of democracy, so as to save emergent democracy.

In this chapter the economist Friedrich Hayek is mentioned for his contritbution to information theory (1945). Markets, so Hayek explained, gather and utilize knowledge which is widely dispersed among individuals. 

The stock market for example can be considered as "the greatest information machine of all time, until the Internet came along." (Harari in Homo Deus has some interesting observations about the tendency to consider all kinds of knowledge as data processing processes). 

Just as we are understanding into more detail what ants are doing (they invented the internet protocol [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite)) we also start applying this logic of emergence - for instance by making Wikipedia or synthetic biology.

Synthetic biology is about creating new genetic sequences to program living things with new properties and functions. It's also a collaboration between students, professors and citizen scientists, the bio-hackers. Faires like [iGEM](http://igem.org/Main_Page) or communities such as [DIYbio](https://diybio.org/) are very important in this context.

Crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo help to finance the projects. A de facto system emerges in which people worldwide are empowered to learn, design, develop, and participate in act of creative disobedience. They make nonlinear innovation possible.

Synthetic biology is also about building a standarized collection of reusable BioBricks - engineers tend to take things apart and see whether they can reconfigure them into something new or something which works better. So there is an element of play involved, and all this was not immediately understood by classical biologists. 

Synthetic biology is itself the product of emergence and shows how institutions such as universities adapt to reap the benefits of the new way of cooperating.
