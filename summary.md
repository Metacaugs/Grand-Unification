**Concluding cybermeeting for this book: Mark, Charles, Robert, Ted, Yannick and Roland took part.** 

- There is the general feeling we **want to do and build stuff**. 
- A **mission statement** is needed, it will help when we reach out to others to join our group. One big project is called **The Grand Unification:** an overview, (also in the form of) a mindmap, of the tools and initiatives out there which enable people to give real answers to real questions and get consensus-building results rather than further divisive social media discussions. (see also the [README at GitHub](https://github.com/impactRI-Ltd/Grand-Unification/blob/master/README.md))
- We are working on different platforms, the [smc-platform](https://smcforum.holocene.cc/),  [Slack](https://hrualumni.slack.com), [Metamaps](https://metamaps.cc/maps/2761), [GitHub](https://github.com/impactRI-Ltd/Grand-Unification) and we also experiment with [Qiark](https://www.qiark.com/index.php). We consider having our main hub on [Podio](https://podio.com/) because SMC is highly and structurally unstable. For now we continue working on Slack which seems to be a good place for ephemeral discussions - we're integrating the GitHub and Metamaps activities there. 
- We're building a [wiki lexicon on GitHub](https://github.com/impactRI-Ltd/Grand-Unification/wiki/Lexicon). 
- The next book we'll read is [Whiplash](http://boingboing.net/2016/12/06/whiplash-joi-itos-nine-prin.html), by Joi Ito and Jeff Howe. Next Sunday we'll discuss the first chapter (including the context of the book). The other important book most of us are reading is [Homo Deus by Harari](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/11/homo-deus-brief-history-tomorrow-yuval-noah-harari-review), A Brief History of Tomorrow. That's a highly thought-provoking book and it could be worthwhile to read it in conjunction with Whiplash.
